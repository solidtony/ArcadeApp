    + When animation is initialized the size of the number of animations is returned for validation.
    
    + The pause method will pause and resume an animation.
    
    + In update the FPS is converted to milliseconds and then compared to time. The time is the time for one frame. When the time is greater than the frames per second then the time is reset for the next frame.
