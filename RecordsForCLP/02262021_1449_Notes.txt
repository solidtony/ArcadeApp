 The Overall Design:
 + Discusses the various aspects of Pacman and what will be needed built.
 
 Loading and Drawing the Level
 + Pacman_level.txt contains all the level information such as pellet locations and walls.
 + Tiles comprise a level
 + For debug purposes the walls which are the collision excludes are displayed. They will not be displayed later on.
 + Layout offset determines where on the screen each tile is drawn.
 + If it is collidable then we make it an Excluder wall.
 + Ran into a runtime error.
    + error was that a pointer to a string was returning a nullptr.
 
 Pacman Game Utils:
 + Making an actor class that will serve as the base for pacman and the ghost.
 + Enum for movement direction
    + Helper functions to deal with the enum
