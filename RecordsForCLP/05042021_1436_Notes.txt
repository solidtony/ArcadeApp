The Actor Class:
 + Actor class will be the base class for both Pacman and the ghosts.
 + Movement is restricted to moving by integer amounts.
 
Pacman Class:
 + Not sure why there is a score on the pacman actor.
 + Had a bug where pacman would animate up but would move right and would animate down but move left.
   -> Issue was that when y was suppose to update the vector that was being updated had x direction instead of y.
   
Collisions:
 + Checks against all walls
 + Pacman is a pointer in PacmanLevel class
 + When pacman collides with a wall pacman is placed so that the bounding box is flush with the collided wall and pacman is stopped.
 
Wrap around:
 + When pacman enters the exit zone pacman should wrap to the other side of the screen.
 + There are are two teleport tiles in the Pacman_level.txt which will be used to teleport from one teleport tile to the next teleport tile.
