The Pellets:
    + Each tile Pacman_level.txt has a tile_exclude_pellet to determine when a pellet will be added.
    + Vector will store all the tiles that are exclusion tiles
    + Unfortunately the power pellets are hard coded in so you can't have the power pellets driven by the level data.
    + Check that pellet does not intersect with a wall or exclussion tile before the pellet is added to the level.
