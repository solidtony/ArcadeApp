The Pellets:
    + Each tile Pacman_level.txt has a tile_exclude_pellet to determine when a pellet will be added.
    + Vector will store all the tiles that are exclusion tiles.
    + Unfortunately the power pellets are hard coded in so you can't have the power pellets driven by the level data.
    + Check that pellet does not intersect with a wall or exclussion tile before the pellet is added to the level.
    
Eating pellets and Drawing the Score:
    + Loops through all pellets.
    + Used namespace in .cpp to create local constant.

Pacman Spawn Location:
    + Pacman's start location will be data driven instead of hard coded.
    
Levels:
