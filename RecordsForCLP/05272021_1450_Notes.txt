Lives:
    + The lives are drawn using the idle sprite from the sprite sheet.
    + The sprite is grabbed from the sprite sheet using the life sprite name
    + We then draw each life using the sprite width and singleton height. Each life is drawn at a distance from the previously drawn life spaced by some developer defined padding and the sprites width.
    
Ghost Class:
    + using enum for ghost names
        + Neat enum trick is to start the enumeration at 0 and have num at the end to have the number of elements available.
        
    + Currently the time ghosts are vunerable looks to be fixed wheres in the real game it is dependent on the level.
