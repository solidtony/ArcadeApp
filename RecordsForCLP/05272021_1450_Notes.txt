Lives:
    + The lives are drawn using the idle sprite from the sprite sheet.
    + The sprite is grabbed from the sprite sheet using the life sprite name
    + We then draw each life using the sprite width and singleton height. Each life is drawn at a distance from the previously drawn life spaced by some developer defined padding and the sprites width.
    
Ghost Class:
    + using enum for ghost names
        + Neat enum trick is to start the enumeration at 0 and have number of entries at the end to have the number of elements available.
        
    + Currently the time ghosts are vulnerable looks to be fixed wheres in the real game it is dependent on the level.
    
GettingGhosts in the Game:
    + Added spawn points to tile
    + Cool vector trick, the index matches the ghost enumeration value.
    + Had a bug where I did not set the ghost vector to the created ghost so it was empty.
    + Have a bug where the ghosts are spawning in but their bodies are not loading and being colored. Still working on the fix.
