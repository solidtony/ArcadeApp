Ghosts AI States:
    + Add modes that determines how the ghosts behave. Initially it will be just with Blinky.
    + Created a ghost enum to store the state.
    + Target is the tile that the ghost trying to maneuver to while in chase. The ghosts will have different target behaviors.
    + Scatter target is where the ghost goes for scatter mode. To achieve an orbit behavior the target will always be outside of boundaries.
    + The ghosts start in scatter mode until the timer exceeds the SCATTER_MODE_DURATION. After that they enter chase mode.
    + When vulnerable, the ghost will wonder around.
    + The algorithm looks ahead in each of the four directions and calculates the distance from the ghost to the look ahead location. The used direction is the one that produces the shortest distance.
    + Blinky's target works but the colors are not working.
    
 The Gate:
    + Added states to store the ghost pen target and the ghost exit pen position. 
    + First the ghost start in the pen and the movement is none.
    + When the timer is greater than the pen wait duration, returned movement is still none. I assume that the position of the ghost will be changed to the pen entrance location. Another thing is that the pen wait duration is a class constant, so the ghosts will exit the pen at the same time? + Does will target the exit location.
    + If the ghost is making its way into the pen and it has reached the pen then the state is switched to IN_PEN. The ghost's state is also switched to ALIVE.
    + Ghosts will be allowed to move through the gate tiles when moving to gate and when in the gate.
    + Loaded in the gate tile from file.
