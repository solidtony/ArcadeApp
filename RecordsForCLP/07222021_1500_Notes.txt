Ghost Delegate:
    + The plan is to decouple the ghost AI from the ghost.
    + Create a GhostDelegate. Ghost does note know it is delegated as an AI. Contains pure virtual functions. Its job is to couple together things that don't know they are coupled together. Essentially a callback to whoever cares about when changes have been made.
    + Splits up responsibility to two different classes. Uses a friend class which usually breaks encapsulation.
