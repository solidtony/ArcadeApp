Section: Fast path 2D Rendering:
    + Implement an SDL2 renderer to pass workload to GPU which will increase performance. Before the rendering was handled by the CPU using a window frame-buffer handled by SDL2.
    
    + SDL_LockTexture:
        Lock portion of texture for write-only pixel access.
            Texture: locked texture for access
            Rect: area to lock for access
            Pixels: pointer to locked pixels
            Pitch: pitch of locked pixels
            
        Used when swapping screens.
        Gives us a pointer to the textured data. The pixels in the back-buffer are memcpy-ed to the texture data.
        Texture is unlocked.
        
        The texture is then copied to the renderer
        The screen is then updated with the rendering performed.
        

Section: A button class
    + Create a button class to introduce a UI into the app.
    + Getting more practice with functions.
        Using it for the button's action.
        
    + Depends on the bitmap font to get text for title.
    
Section: Button options scene
    + Creating a buttons options scene so that the game can be selected from the main menu.
    
    + Game controller input is set up in the Init method so that actions can be performed. The game controller member variable is part of the base class scene.
