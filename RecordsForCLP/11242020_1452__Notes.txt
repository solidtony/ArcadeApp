Section: Fast path 2D Rendering:
    + Implement an SDL2 renderer to pass workload to GPU which will increase performance. Before the rendering was handled by the CPU using a window framebuffer handled by SDL2.
    
    + SDL_LockTexture:
        Lock portionof texture for write-only pixel access.
            Texture: locked texture for access
            Rect: area to lock for access
            Pixels: pointer to locked pixels
            Pitch: pitch of locekd pixels
            
        Used when swapping screens.
        Gives us a pointer to the textured data. The pixels in the backbuffer are memcpy-ed to the texture data.
        Texture is unlocked.
        
        The texture is then copied to the renderer
        The screen is then updated with the rendering performed.
