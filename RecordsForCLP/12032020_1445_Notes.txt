Section: Restructuring the App:
    + ArcadeScene Init was changed setup the button actions.
    + Had a type which took a while to find. Was missing the "()" at the end of a method call in the constructor for AppScene.
    + Took a while to fix the issue where all scenes where selected at start-up.
        The issue was that the mHighlightedOptions was defaulted to true rather then false. Changed it to false.
    
Section: Animation Data:
    + Introduces animations text that is to being used in conjunction with the sprite sheet and sprite text.
    + Animation sheet:
        - animation name
        - sprite sheet reference
        - frames per second - important for playback
        - number of frame keys - contains the number of frames
        - frame keys - lists the name in the sprite sheet of each frame of the animation.
        
        For the ghosts:
        - overlay - the body and the eyes will be overlaid.
        - frame colors - to change the colors of the sprite depending on the state of the game.
        - overlay colors
        
Section: The Animation Class
    + Created a struct which holds all the data for the animation frame.
    + Created a class (which should have just been a struct) that mostly stores the animation data.
        - The one method that is really useful is the GetAnimationFrame
            + Input is the frame number
            + if frame num is greater than the frames size than we return a default frame. I think the default frame should be a unique sprite so that issues are visually distinct.
            
Section: Loading Animations
    + Wrote a method that loads all the animations at once.
